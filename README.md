# Odin Recipes

Welcome to my first project from The Odin Project! 🎉

I created a simple recipe page and since I'm a vegetarian, all 3 recipes are plant-based:

    Roasted Veggies 🥕
    Veggie Lasagna 🍝
    Veggie Soup 🍲

I didn't spend too much time on this one because I can't wait to dive into more complex projects.

Happy cooking! 🍽️
